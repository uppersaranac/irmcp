# Naming of Chemical Substances

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- These ruse are used to generate names for chemicals in the NIST Spectral Libraries.
- Every **unique chemical structure** receives one **unique name**.
- Unless using common names, names are **structure-based**, aiming for **consistency, uniqueness, and retrievability** in databases.
- For ease of comparison, the section numbers follow the [Naming and Indexing of
Chemical Substances for
Chemical Abstracts](https://web.cas.org/marketing/pdf/indexguideapp.pdf).

## A. Nomenclature Systems and General Principles (¶101–139)

### 101. Foreword

This guide details the selection of chemical substance names. It is not a comprehensive nomenclature manual for all of chemistry but a specific guide to how the names in the the NIST spectral libraries are constructed, ordered, and formatted. The primary goal is to enable a user to locate specific chemical substances within an alphabetical index. The nomenclature generally follows the rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) but is adapted for the rigid requirements of an alphabetical listing, ensuring that structurally related substances appear in juxtaposition (e.g., parents followed by their derivatives).

### 103. Introduction

In scientific literature, a single compound may have multiple names (e.g., *2-Aminoethanol* vs. *Ethanolamine*). To avoid scattering information, a single preferred index name is selected for each substance. For the provided list, systematic names are preferred over trivial names to ensure consistency and retrievability.

### 104. Inversion of Names

To group related substances, index names are inverted. The **Heading Parent** (the main part of the molecule) is listed first, followed by a comma, and then the **Substituents**. If a derivative (like an ester or salt) is present, it appears in the **Modification** at the end of the name.

- *Example from list:* **Acetic acid, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-, methyl ester**
  - *Heading Parent:* Acetic acid
  - *Substituent:* 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-
  - *Modification:* methyl ester

### 106. Order of Precedence of Compound Classes

When a compound contains multiple functional groups, the Heading Parent is chosen based on a strict order of precedence. The class higher in the list becomes the parent, while lower classes are expressed as prefixes (substituents).

1. **Acids**: Carboxylic acids rank highest among common organic functions.
    - *Example:* **Benzoic acid, 4-amino-** (Acid is parent; amine is substituent).
2. **Amides**: Lower than acids but higher than nitriles.
    - *Example:* **Benzamide, 3-methyl-**.
3. **Nitriles**:
    - *Example:* **Benzonitrile, 2-fluoro-**.
4. **Aldehydes**:
    - *Example:* **Benzaldehyde, 4-methoxy-**.
5. **Ketones**:
    - *Example:* **2-Butanone, 3-chloro-**.
6. **Alcohols**:
    - *Example:* **1-Butanol, 2-methyl-**.
7. **Amines**:
    - *Example:* **1-Butanamine, N-butyl-**.

### 108. Punctuation

Punctuation is critical for clarity.

- **Commas** separate locants (e.g., *2,3-dichloro*) and the parent from substituents in inverted names.
- **Hyphens** join locants to names (e.g., *4-chloro-*).
- **Italics** are used for locants like *N-* or *O-* and stereochemical descriptors like *cis-* or *trans-*.
  - *Example:* **Acetamide, N-phenyl-**.

### 109. Enclosing Marks

Parentheses `()` and brackets `[]` are used to prevent ambiguity, particularly when a substituent itself is substituted (compound radicals).

- *Example:* **Benzoic acid, 4-[[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)amino]carbonyl]-**
  - Here, brackets enclose the complex substituent group attached to the parent Benzoic acid.

### 110. Multiplicative Prefixes

Prefixes such as *di-*, *tri-*, *tetra-* are used for simple substituents. For compound substituents or to avoid ambiguity, *bis-*, *tris-*, *tetrakis-* are used.

- *Example (Simple):* **Benzene, 1,3-dichloro-**.
- *Example (Complex):* **Ethanone, 1,1'-(1,3-phenylene)bis-**.

### 113. Order of Citation in Modifications

Derivatives in the modification phrase (following the inverted name) are cited in a specific order: salts, then esters, then other functional derivatives.

- *Example:* **Glycine, N-acetyl-, methyl ester** (Ester cited in modification).

### 114-118. Locants

Locants (numbers or letters) indicate the position of substituents on the skeleton.

- **Low Numbering:** The skeleton is numbered to give the lowest possible locants to the principal group, then to double bonds, then to substituents.
  - *Example:* **2-Butanone** (Not 3-Butanone).
- **Heteroatoms:** In acyclic chains with heteroatoms, locants are assigned to the heteroatoms where possible.
- **Multiplicative Nomenclature:** When two identical parents are linked, locants distinguish the positions.
  - *Example:* **1,1'-Biphenyl, 4,4'-dichloro-**.

### 122. Tautomers

For compounds that exist in equilibrium between two forms (tautomers), a single preferred form is chosen for the index name to avoid scattering. Common examples include ketones vs. enols and amides vs. imidic acids.

- *Example:* **2-Pyridinone** is preferred over *2-Pyridinol* when the oxo-form is dominant or preferred by rule.
- *Example from list:* **2,4(1H,3H)-Pyrimidinedione** is used instead of the Uracil trivial name.

### 130. Substitutive Nomenclature

This is the fundamental system used for most organic compounds in the list. A hydrogen atom on the parent skeleton is "substituted" by a radical (group).

- *Example:* **Benzene, chloromethyl-** (A hydrogen on benzene is replaced by a chloromethyl group).

### 135. Indicated Hydrogen

For cyclic systems where the position of double bonds requires specification of a saturated atom, "Indicated Hydrogen" is used (e.g., *1H-*, *2H-*).

- *Example:* **1H-Indole** vs. **3H-Indole**.
- *Example from list:* **1H-Benzotriazole, 1-methyl-**.

## B. Molecular Skeletons (¶140–163A)

### 141. Acyclic Hydrocarbons

Saturated chains are named Alkanes (e.g., *Butane*, *Pentane*). Unsaturated chains take suffixes like *-ene* (Alkenes) or *-yne* (Alkynes).

- *Example:* **1-Pentene**; **1-Octyne**.

### 145. Cycloalkanes and Cycloalkenes

Monocyclic hydrocarbons are named by attaching the prefix *cyclo-* to the acyclic name.

- *Example:* **Cyclopentane**; **Cyclohexene**.

### 146. Monocyclic Heterocycles

Rings containing heteroatoms (N, O, S) are named using Hantzsch-Widman stems or retained trivial names.

### 147. Fused Ring Systems

Polycyclic systems formed by sharing adjacent atoms are named by combining component names or using trivial names.

- *Example:* **Naphthalene**; **Quinoline** (Benzene fused to Pyridine); **Benzofuran**.

### 148. Bridged Ring Systems

Systems with shared atoms that are not adjacent are named using the Von Baeyer system (e.g., Bicyclo[x.y.z]alkane).

- *Example:* **Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane**; **Adamantane**.

### 156. Spiro Systems

Systems where two rings share a single atom are named *Spiro*.
